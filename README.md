# KeyLogger in C++

<h1>KeyLogger for Windows only</h1>

Played around and made for fun. Made for educational purposes only, I don't take any responsibility in its use. I haven't added a network feature to it yet so its pretty much code to showcase how these things work on a host machine

To compile:<br><br>
`g++ logger.cpp -o logger.exe`
<br><br>
Then run the executable and see the magic!
